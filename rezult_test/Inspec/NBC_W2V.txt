Clausal resolution in a logic of rational agency
A resolution based proof system for a Temporal Logic of Possible Belief is
	presented. This logic is the combination of the branching-time temporal
	logic CTL (representing change over time) with the modal logic KD45
	(representing belief). Such combinations of temporal or dynamic logics
	and modal logics are useful for specifying complex properties of
	multi-agent systems. Proof methods are important for developing
	verification techniques for these complex multi-modal logics.
	Soundness, completeness and termination of the proof method are shown
	and simple examples illustrating its use are given

Local search with constraint propagation and conflict-based heuristics
Search algorithms for solving CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) usually
	fall into one of two main families: local search algorithms and
	systematic algorithms. Both families have their advantages. Designing
	hybrid approaches seems promising since those advantages may be
	combined into a single approach. In this paper, we present a new hybrid
	technique. It performs a local search over partial assignments instead
	of complete assignments, and uses filtering techniques and
	conflict-based techniques to efficiently guide the search. This new
	technique benefits from both classical approaches: a priori pruning of
	the search space from filtering-based search and possible repair of
	early mistakes from local search. We focus on a specific version of
	this technique: tabu decision-repair. Experiments done on open-shop
	scheduling problems show that our approach competes well with the best
	highly specialized algorithms

Bit-serial AB/sup 2/ multiplier using modified inner product
This paper presents a new multiplication algorithm and, based on this
	algorithm, proposes a hardware architecture, called modified
	inner-product multiplier (MIPM), which computes AB/sup 2/
	multiplication based on a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). The
	algorithm is based on the property of the irreducible all one
	polynomial (AOP) over the finite field GF(2/sup m/). The proposed
	architecture reduces the time and space complexity for computing AB/sup
	2/. The proposed architecture has a potential application to
	implementing exponentiation architecture for a public-key cryptosystem

Yet some more complexity results for default logic
We identify several new tractable subsets and several new intractable simple
	cases for reasoning in the propositional version of Reiter's default
	logic. The majority of our findings are related to brave reasoning. By
	making some intuitive observations, most classes that we identify can
	be derived quite easily from some subsets of default logic already
	known in the literature. Some of the subsets we discuss are subclasses
	of the so-called "extended logic programs". All the tractable subsets
	presented in this paper can be recognized in linear time

Digital rights (and wrongs)
Attempting to grasp the many conflicts and proposed safeguards for intellectual
	property is extremely difficult. Legal, political, economic, and
	cultural issues-both domestic and international-loom large, almost
	dwarfing the daunting technological challenges. Solutions devised by
	courts and legislatures and regulatory agencies are always late out of
	the blocks and fall ever farther behind. Recently proposed legislation
	only illustrates the depth and complexity of the problem

Reinventing broadband
Many believe that broadband providers need to change their whole approach. The
	future, then, is in reinventing broadband. That means tiered pricing to
	make broadband more competitive with dial-up access and livelier, more
	distinct content: video on demand, MP3, and other features exclusive to
	the fat-pipe superhighway

Estimation of thermal coefficients of magneto-optical media
Previously we described a method for estimating the thermal conductivity of
	magneto-optic recording media. The method relies on identifying the
	laser power that brings the maximum temperature of the TbFeCo layer to
	as high as the Curie temperature. We extensively use a similar method
	to estimate the heat capacity of a dielectric layer, a TbFeCo layer,
	and an aluminum alloy layer of magneto-optic recording media.
	Measurements are conducted on static disks with a beam of light focused
	on a TbFeCo layer. The method has the advantage of thermal diffusion
	depending on a multilayer structure and irradiation time

The Internet, knowledge and the academy
As knowledge is released from the bounds of libraries, as research becomes no
	longer confined to the academy, and education/certification is
	available, any time/any place, the university and the faculty must
	redefine themselves. Liberal studies, once the core, and currently
	eschewed in favor of science and technology, will be reborn in those
	institutions that can rise above the mundane and embrace an emerging
	"third culture"

Genetic algorithm-neural network estimation of Cobb angle from torso asymmetry
	in scoliosis
Scoliosis severity, measured by the Cobb angle, was estimated by artificial
	neural network from indices of torso surface asymmetry using a genetic
	algorithm to select the optimal set of input torso indices. Estimates
	of the Cobb angle were accurate within 5 degrees in two-thirds, and
	within 10 degrees in six-sevenths, of a test set of 115 scans of 48
	scoliosis patients, showing promise for future longitudinal studies to
	detect scoliosis progression without use of X-rays

A round of cash, a pound of flesh [telecom]
Despite the upheaval across telecom, venture capital firms are still investing
	in start-ups. But while a promising idea and a catchy name were enough

Santera targets independents in major strategy overhaul [telecom]
With big carriers slashing capital expense budgets, Santera Systems is
	broadening the reach of its next-generation switching platform to
	include independent telcos. This week, the vendor will announce that it
	has signed a deal with Kerman, Calif-based Kerman Telephone Co.
	Furthermore, the company is angling for inclusion in the Rural
	Utilities Service's approved equipment list, hoping to sell its Class 5
	replacement boxes to the smallest carriers. The move is almost a
	complete reversal for the Plano, Texas-based vendor, which previously
	focused solely on large carriers, including the RBOCs

A distributed mobile agent framework for maintaining persistent distance
	education
Mobile agent techniques involve distributed control if communication is
	required among different types of agents, especially when mobile agents
	can migrate from station to station. This technique can be implemented
	in a distributed distance learning environment, which allows students
	or instructors to login from anywhere to a central server in an
	education center while still retaining the look-and-feel of personal
	setups. In this research paper, we propose a distributed agent
	framework along with its communication messages to facilitate mobile
	personal agents, which serve three different groups of distance
	education users: instructors, students, and system administrators. We
	propose an agent communication framework as well as agent evolution
	states of mobile agents. The communication architecture and message
	transmission protocols are illustrated. The system is implemented on
	the Windows platform to support nomadic accessibility of remote
	distance learning users. Personal data also migrate with the mobile
	agents, allowing users to maintain accessibility to some extent even
	when the Internet connection is temperately disconnected. Using
	user-friendly personal agents, a distance education platform can
	include different tools to meet different needs for users
