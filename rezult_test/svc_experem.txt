Efficient allocation of knowledge in distributed business structures
Accelerated business processes demand new concepts and realizations of
	information systems and knowledge databases. This paper presents the
	concept of the collaborative information space (CIS), which supplies
	the necessary tools to transform individual knowledge into collective
	useful information. The creation of 'information objects' in the CIS
	allows an efficient allocation of information in all business process
	steps at any time. Furthermore, the specific availability of
	heterogeneous, distributed data is realized by a Web-based user
	interface, which enables effective search by a multidimensionally
	hierarchical composition

This paper describes a pattern recognition (PR) technique, which uses learning
	vector quantization (LVQ). This method is adapted for practical
	application to solve problems in the area of condition monitoring and
	fault diagnosis where a number of fault signatures are involved. In
	these situations, the aim is health monitoring, including
	identification of deterioration of the healthy condition and
	identification of causes of the failure in real-time. For this reason a
	fault database is developed which contains the collected information
	about various states of operation of the system in the form of pattern
	vectors. The task of the real-time monitoring system is to correlate
	patterns of unknown faults with the known fault signatures in the fault
	database. This will determine cause of failure and degree of
	deterioration of the system under test. The problem of fault diagnosis
	may involve a large number of patterns and large sampling time, which
	affects the learning stage of neural networks. The study here also aims
	to find a fast learning model of neural networks for instances when a
	high number of patterns and numerous processing elements are involved.
	It begins searching for an appropriate solution. The study is extended
	to the enforcement learning models and considers LVQ as a network
	emerged from the competitive learning model through enforcement
	training. Finally, tests show an accuracy of 92.3 per cent in the fault
	diagnostic capability of the technique

	system
This paper describes an investigation of the effects of dynamic job routing and
	job sequencing decisions on the performance of a distributed control
	system and its adaptability against disturbances. This experimental
	work was carried out to compare the performance of alternative control
	strategies in various manufacturing environments and to investigate the
	relationship between the 'control' and 'controlled' systems. The
	experimental test-bed presented in this paper consists of an
	agent-based control system (implemented in C++) and a discrete-event
	simulation model. Using this test-bed, various control strategies were
	tested on a benchmark manufacturing system by varying production
	volumes (to model the production system with looser/tighter schedules)
	and disturbance frequencies. It was found that hybrid strategies that
	combine reactive agent mechanisms (and allocation strategies such as
	the contract net) with appropriate job sequencing heuristics provide
	the best performance, particularly when job congestion increases on a
	shop-floor
